                Welcome to module two. This module is all about foundations of cascading style sheets. We will start with the basics, move on to rule conflict resolution, the box model, and CSS layout techniques. Then, we'll be learning how to use media queries and code responsive websites without any frameworks. It would be a mistake to jump straight to a responsive frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap without first understanding the foundation topics. We will finish up the module with an introduction to the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework, which is one of the most popular CSS frameworks today. Keep going and you will finish the course in no time. See you in the module
